# Picatz Guides

An assortment of general guides I've currated for general teaching purposes focusing on red / blue team methodologies and tasks. 

## Why

- I wanted a centralized area to accumulate and share knowledge. 
- I want to be able to help prepare my teammates for competions. 
- Extend my knowledge of general computery things. 
- Hack the Planet!

### Disclaimer

I don't claim to have written every sentence in these guides. I've written quite a bit myself, and have read / formatted quite a bit of information I've been able to gather from various internet resources to help curate a helpful, generally comprehensive guide though.
